# Programming Patterns

* Adapter: helps two incompatible interfaces to work together
* Builder: create complex objects that are hard to configure
* Command: performs some specific task without having any information about the receiver of the request
* Composite: builds a hierarchy of tree objects and interacts with all them the same way
* Decorator: vary the responsibilities of an object adding some features
* Factory: create objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created
* Interpreter: provides a specialized language to solve a well defined problem of know domain
* Iterator: provides a way to access a collection of sub-objects without exposing the underlaying representation
* Observer: helps building a highly integrated system, maintainable and avoids coupling between classes
* Proxy: allows us having more control over how and when we access to a certain object
* Singleton: have a single instance of certain class across the application
* Strategy: varies part of an algorithm at runtime
* Template Method: redefines certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
* Visitor patter: separate an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates
